## Currency Conversion

## Description

This program reads some currency pairs and their rates from json file, then provide an adjacent matrix based of Bellman-Ford algorithm 
to find best rate for converting currencies that have no direct way (as defined in config file). It uses singleton pattern to 
avoid creating and calculating frequent matrix of currency rates.

It was developed by .NET 5.0 and I used C# for programming language. 

## Tests

It contains some tests developed by xUnit Tests and can be a convenient source for start testing.
